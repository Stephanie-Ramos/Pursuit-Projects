//               Classes
//==============================================

// classes: building block that enable us to create complex "objects" in our program. Those objects are created using properties and methods.

//==============================================
//               Class Syntax
//==============================================

class MyFirstClass { // without any parenthesis for now
}

// Day does not has added functionality to count how many cases it has.
// enum Day confirms to caseiterable in order to get more functionality
// caseIterable is a built in protocol

//==============================================
//          Inheritance
//==============================================

// class does not inherit from other structs.
// only classes can inherit from other classes
// parents cannot inherit from classes (children)
class Person { // are these also like attributes? üí° Structs are preferred.
    var name = "Jane" // these are stored properties because you already have them in your class datatype.
    var age = 1
    
    // instance method
    func info() {
        print("This is a person name is \(name) and age is \(age)")
    }
}
// Fellow inherts from Person
// Fellow is a subclass of Person
// Person is the parent or superclass of Fellow
// In Swift, we only have single inheritance, meaning you can ONLY inherit from one parent
    // object-oriented programming consists on those concepts:
    //-inhertaince
    //-encapsulation use private access modifiers on your properties and access them externally through methods ‚ò¢Ô∏è‚è∫ initialize your variables with the Parent/ subparent classes.
    //-polymorphism - changing the form of an object ‚ò¢Ô∏è‚è∫ // this is done with property values that are engaged in the initializers and modifications, and referenced to the Parent and subparent classes.
        // The class Fellow inherits from the Person class above
            //second class method
class Fellow: Person { // class within a class.
    // func info { this does not compile because parent has the same method name so fellow needs to use the override keyword // üí° this would only work. All of the classes have their individual block of code.
    override func info () { // this does not change the original. ü§ôüèΩ‚è∫. You can still access the info without a for loop by creating an instance of Person().
    print("\(name), this is a fellow at Pursuit and is \(age) years old")
    }
}
   // In order to link the classes you must declare the class Parent Name üí°
 
class Employee: Person {
    
    var position = "iOS Developer" // properities ‚ò¢Ô∏è‚è∫ These are the attributes you want for an Employee coming from a Person.
    var salary = 85_000
    
    // instance methods
    override func info() {
        print("\(position) is making $\(salary)")
    }
}

// In creating an instance of Fellow(), you would use let or var
let brendon = Fellow() // from what fellow is it grabbing? from shortly  above. which is inheritance form the parent above.
brendon.name = "Brendon"
brendon.age = 31
brendon.info() // from the func info at Fellow() it gets executed. ‚ò¢Ô∏è‚è∫
   
// before Fellow() from Person which overrode info() method from the info() at Person class, the output from the print statement:
// This person name is Brendon and age is 31.
   
// after overriding info() in the Fellow class the print statement comes from the override method
// Brendon is a fellow at Pursuit and is 31 years old.

// On the other hand
//struct Artist { // this does not compile. Struct cannot inherit from other structs
//
//}
//struct PopStar: Artist {
//}

//==============================================
//  Polymorphism - Changing Form on an Object
//==============================================

// instance of a Person
let tom = Person()
tom.name = "Tom"
tom.age = 5 // without this the declared default value for age is 1 for all instances: tom, john, and bienbenido.

// instance of an Employee
let john = Employee()
john.name = "John"
john.age = 6

// instance of a Fellow
let bienbenido = Fellow() //the datatype is a Fellow
bienbenido.name = "Beinbenido"
bienbenido.age = 10

// ‚õîÔ∏è
// an array of instances from above
let people = [tom, john, bienbenido] // an array of instances from Person/Parent Class üí°. The elements are our variables perviously called before. perhaps this is because of the first index of the array.


// if we were to loop over the people array what for example would be the info() message for bienbenido.
for person in people { // this prints based on what you overrode on your print statements per class either in Parent or subclass.üí°
    print(person.info())
}
   
// this still prints all the statements from info.
let age = [john, tom, bienbenido]
for instance in age {
    print(instance.info()) // our console log has printed info twice for a for loop! When you want to use a for loop for all of your information üí° use the info to print all of the statements in the for loop.
