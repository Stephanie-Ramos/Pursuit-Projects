// Structs: is a building block of a method in which we emulate an "object" in Swift

// Struct Syntax

//SomeStruct below defines an "object"
//Object-oriented programming (OOP) - encapsulates properties and methods on real world objects.
struct SomeStruct {
    // definition of the struct includes the following:
    // properties - variables or constants on the data type (struct)
    // initializers - the method in which you create a type
    // methods - function inside of a custom type (struct)
}

struct Resolution {
    // properties
    // stored properties - a property with a defualt value
    // a property is a variable or constant
    
    var width = 0
    var height = 0
    
}

//==============================================
//   Create an Instance of Resolution Project
//==============================================

var someResolution = Resolution()
//cant declare it with a constant

//accessing properties of Resolution by using dot syntax
someResolution.width = 180 // from the Resolution

print(someResolution)
//prints Resolution(width: 180, height: 0) // prints all the properties and the current values per initializer

// structs have a (memberwise initializer) as opposed to a class that does not
// memberwise initializer is only avaliable in structs
var vga = Resolution(width: 640, height: 480)
print(vga)

//==============================================
//     Structs and Enums are Value Types
//==============================================

let hd = Resolution(width: 1920, height: 1080)
// the properties are width and height

var cinema = hd
// cinema is copied of hd above in the constant
// this does not change the original copy

// what is teh value of cinema here // 1920
print(cinema.width)// 1920

cinema.width = 2048

// what is the value of hd's width?
print(hd.width) // this would be 2048
